# razorPayClone
I created an impressive front-end replica of Rajor Pay using Tailwind CSS, delivering a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The clone showcases a sleek and modern design, 
allowing users to effortlessly navigate through various payment features. It offers a seamless user experience, enabling users to initiate transactions, view payment history,
 and manage their account settings, all within an intuitive interface. The project demonstrates my proficiency in crafting attractive front-end designs and effectively implementing
 user-friendly interactions using Tailwind CSS
